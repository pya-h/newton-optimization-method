# Newton Optimization Method

* Implements Newton Method for finding extremum point and optimal value of a function.

* Inputs are obvious. Just enter your symbolic function and the parameters asked in the prompt.

* Enter the parameters exactly in the requested format. (Just like default values format)

* In MultiVariable newton method, remember Hessian of the function must have an inverse (Det != 0),
    and Some initial values are not suitable.
